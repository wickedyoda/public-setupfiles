# Public Setup Files

This repository contains a collection of scripts and configuration snippets I use across various systems. Most scripts target Debian/Ubuntu Linux, but you'll also find utilities for macOS, Raspberry Pi, OpenWrt, and Docker environments. The goal is to speed up system deployment and automate routine maintenance tasks.
